# This file specifies the files and folders that Git should ignore.

# 1. Dependencies
# The node_modules folder contains all third-party packages.
# It can get very large and should be generated locally with `npm install`.
node_modules/

# 2. Log Files
# Log files generated during execution or debugging.
logs/
*.log
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
pnpm-debug.log*

# 3. Build and TypeScript Compilation Files
# The `dist` (or `build`) folder contains the JavaScript code generated from TypeScript.
# The source code (.ts) is the source of truth, so compiled files do not need to be versioned.
dist/
build/
*.tsbuildinfo

# 4. Environment Variables
# .env files contain secrets and environment-specific settings (API keys, database passwords, etc.).
# It is a major security vulnerability to version these files.

# The line below is an exception to allow an example file, which is good practice.
